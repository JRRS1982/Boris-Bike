# Project title

Boris Bikes is the week 1 afternoon project of the Makers Academy Bootcamp.

### Motivation / Approach

This project was made to develop my Object Orientated Programming Skills, and to
practice the base skills in Ruby, including encapsulations, mocking / stubbing
and associated test driven development.

I decided to redo the project as I decided that it would be good practice to
repeat the earlier attempts (which were pair programmed) by myself at a later
stage to see how far I have come and to complete the project hopefully to a
better standard.

### Build status

The project is currently under construction, it may not be completed as this is
a practice exercise.

### Screenshots / UML / Notes / Diagrams

Should there be any images, please find them in the images folder of the project.

### User Stories

As a lover of bicycles,
I want a docking station to release a bike for me to ride,
so that I can get around London quicker.

As a lover of bicycles,
I want to return my bicycle to the docking station after i have finished,
so that I dont get charged for having it for too long.

As a lover of bicycles,
I dont want to be given a faulty bike from the docking station,
so that I can actually use it as intended.

As a lover of bicycles,
so that i am not charged unneccsessarily,
I dont want to be given a bike if there are none available.

AT COMPLETIONG: PROGRESS OF SOLVING THE USER STORIES, HOW FAR DID I GET IN SOLVING THEM?

### Problem solving - workings

The inputs will be strings, a command to the terminal requesting an action.

The output will be a bike object string, or an string error message.

## Tech / framework used

An apple macbook was used to write code using VSCode as an editor and;

* Ruby was used as the main language.
* RSpec used for testing.
* Simplecov is used for test coverage.

### Code style

Rubocop 0.65.0 was used for linting and stylying the Ruby code.

### Tests

A TDD process was used in the development of this project, please see the
attached spec files for details of the testing that was carried out.

## Installation / Running / How it works

Please find attached a gem file listing those gems for installation, use the
following to run the file:

1) ruby app.rb

## API Use

No API used in this project.

## Reflection / further development

WHAT FURTHER FEATURES WOULD I ADD IF I HAD MORE TIME?

## Credits / team members

No contributions are required at this time, as this is a training exercise.

This is a solo project that does not require referencing to any exteral source.

NOW CREATE A FEATURE TEST FIRST

describe 'Greeter' do
  it 'greets Rico' do
    expect(greet('Rico')).to eq('Hello, Rico, how are you today?')
  end
