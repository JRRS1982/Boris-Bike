This is a readme for the Boris Bikes Pair Programming Exercise

The purpose of this exercise was to pair with others, working with RSpec and a TDD process to raise errors, resolving them as we go, to develop a programme which will produce a bike docking system, which is similar in style to the London Santander cycles.
