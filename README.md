# Boris Bikes

This is a readme for the Boris Bikes Coding Project, a week 1 project from the
Makers Academy Bootcamp, so here you will find an example of work carried out
at the early stage of my coding career.

We paired daily for the exercise, in in the afternoons, alternating between
driver and naviagtor to develop both an ability to work in a team,
collaboratively while learning the fundamentals of OOP coding in Ruby.

The purpose of this exercise was to pair with others, working with RSpec and a
TDD process to raise errors, resolving them as we go, to develop a programme
which will produce a bike docking system, which is similar in style to the
London Santander cycles.
