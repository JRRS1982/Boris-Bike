# Boris Bikes

This is a readme for the Boris Bikes Coding Project, a week 1 project from the
Makers Academy Bootcamp, so here you will find an example of work carried out
at the early stage of my coding career.

Since initially completing the project with Alex and Marsha i returned and
completed the project again, please see the folders for each attempt with their
own readme's enclosed here.

We paired daily for the exercise, in in the afternoons, alternating between
driver and naviagtor to develop both an ability to work in a team,
collaboratively while learning the fundamentals of OOP coding in Ruby.
